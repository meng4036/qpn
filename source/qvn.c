/**
* @description
* QF_run() is typically called from your startup code after you initialize
* the QF and start at least one active object with QActive_start().
* This implementation of QF_run() is for the cooperative Vanilla kernel.
*
* @returns QF_run() typically does not return in embedded applications.
* However, when QP runs on top of an operating system,  QF_run() might
* return and in this case the return represents the error code (0 for
* success). Typically the value returned from QF_run() is subsequently
* passed on as return from main().
